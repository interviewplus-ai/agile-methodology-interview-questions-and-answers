## 1. What is Agile methodology?

Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Agile frameworks, such as Scrum and Kanban, promote adaptive planning, shorter development cycles called sprints, and frequent feedback from stakeholders.

## 2. What are the key principles of Agile methodology?

The key principles of Agile methodology include customer collaboration, responding to change, delivering working software in short iterations, embracing cross-functional teams, promoting face-to-face communication, and valuing individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Agile also emphasizes simplicity, continuous learning, and the ability to adapt to evolving requirements.

## 3. What are the benefits of using Agile methodology?

Agile methodology offers several benefits, including improved flexibility and responsiveness to change, enhanced collaboration and communication among team members, faster delivery of working software, increased customer satisfaction through continuous feedback, better risk management, and greater transparency and visibility into project progress.

## 4. What are the roles in Agile development teams?

Agile development teams typically consist of three primary roles: the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Development Team. The Product Owner represents the stakeholders and defines the product vision and requirements. The Scrum Master facilitates the Scrum process, removes obstacles, and ensures adherence to Agile principles. The Development Team comprises cross-functional members responsible for delivering the product increment.

## 5. What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall methodologies?

Agile and Waterfall methodologies are two contrasting approaches to project management. Agile is iterative, adaptive, and emphasizes collaboration and flexibility. Waterfall is sequential, predictive, and follows a predefined plan. Agile focuses on delivering incremental value throughout the project, while Waterfall aims to complete each phase before moving to the next. Agile allows for changes, while Waterfall follows a fixed scope and plan.

## 6. What is a user story in Agile methodology?

In Agile methodology, a user story is a concise, informal description of a feature or functionality from an end-user perspective. It follows a simple template: "As a [user role], I want [a goal] so that [benefit or value]." User stories capture the requirements and serve as a basis for prioritization, estimation, and development tasks during Agile iterations.

## 7. What is a sprint in Agile methodology?

A sprint is a time-boxed iteration in Agile methodology where a cross-functional development team works on a set of prioritized user stories or product backlog items. Sprints typically last 1-4 weeks and aim to deliver a potentially shippable product increment. During a sprint, team members collaborate, perform development tasks, conduct daily stand-up meetings, and review and adapt their plans.

## 8. How does Agile handle changing requirements?

Agile methodology handles changing requirements through iterative and incremental development. Changes can be accommodated at the beginning of each sprint or iteration. Agile teams embrace change and work closely with stakeholders to prioritize and incorporate new requirements, allowing for flexibility and adapting to evolving needs throughout the project.

## 9. What is the purpose of daily stand-up meetings in Agile?

Daily stand-up meetings, also known as daily scrums, are short, time-boxed meetings where the development team gathers to synchronize their work. Each team member answers three questions: What did I accomplish yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any obstacles or issues? Stand-up meetings foster transparency, communication, and coordination among team members, helping to identify and address any blockers quickly.

## 10 What is the Definition of Done (DoD) in Agile?

The Definition of Done (DoD) is a shared understanding among the Agile team of the criteria that a user story or product increment must meet to be considered complete. It defines the quality standards, testing requirements, documentation, and any other necessary deliverables for each item. The DoD ensures that work is finished and ready for release, providing clarity and aligning expectations.

## 11. How does Agile support continuous improvement?

Agile methodology supports continuous improvement through retrospectives. Retrospectives are regular meetings where the team reflects on their work, identifies areas for improvement, and defines actionable steps to enhance their processes, collaboration, and overall effectiveness. Agile teams use feedback from retrospectives to implement changes and optimize their performance in subsequent iterations.
